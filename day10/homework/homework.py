#first example

#We iterated the name and counted how many times the name was repeated

# result = 0

# for name in range(5):
#     print("Giorgi")
#     result = result + 1
   
# print(result)




#second example

#We have shown even and odd numbers from 0 to 10

# for i in range(10):
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         print(i,"is even")
#     else:
#         print(i,"is odd")





#third example

#sum of the numbers from 1 to 10

# result = 0
# for i  in range (1,11):
#     result = result + i

# print(result)



#fourth example

#We displayed the numbers from 1 to 10 and iterated the name 

# sum = 0

# for num in range(1,10):
#     print(num)
#     print("Giorgi")
#     sum = sum + num




#fifth example

#We multiply all numbers from 1 to 20 by 2



# for num in range(1, 20):
#     print(num * 2)






#sixth example

# total = 0

# for i in range(1,100):
#     total = total + i

# print(total)



#seventh example

#multipliyng even numbers from 1 to 10

# for i in range(1, 10):
#    if i % 2 == 0:
#         print(i * 2)




#eighth example
