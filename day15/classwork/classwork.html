    <h2>World water day </h2>
    <p>World Water Day is an annual United Nations (UN) observance day held on the 22nd of March that highlights <br> the importance of fresh water. The day is used to advocate for the sustainable management of freshwater resources.[1] The theme of each year focuses on topics relevant to clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), which is in line with the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 6.[2] The UN World Water Development Report (WWDR) is released each year around World Water Day.

        UN-Water is the convener for World Water Day and selects the theme for each year in consultation with UN <br>organizations that share an interest in that year's focus.[1] The theme for 2021 was "Valuing Water" and the public campaign invited people to join a global conversation on social media to "tell us your stories, thoughts and feelings about water".[3]
        
        In 2020, the theme was "Water and Climate Change".[4] Previous themes for the years 2016 to 2019 were  <br> "Water and Jobs'",[5] "Why waste water?"[6] "Nature for Water",[7] and "Leaving no one behind".[8] World Water Day is celebrated around the world with a variety of events. These can be theatrical, musical or lobbying in nature. The day can also include campaigns to raise money for water projects. The first World Water Day, designated by the United Nations, was in 1993.[1]</p>
         



    <h3>Objectives and structure</h3>
    <p>World Water Day is an international observance day. The intention is to inspire people around the world to <br> learn more about water-related issues and to take action to make a difference.[1] In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an additional focus on hand washing and hygiene.[9]

        Relevant issues include water scarcity, water pollution, inadequate water supply, lack of sanitation, and the <br> impacts of climate change (which is the theme of World Water Day 2020[10]). The day brings to light the inequality of access to WASH services and the need to assure the human right to water and sanitation.
        
        The World Water Day website announces events, activities and volunteer opportunities. In 2020, featured stories are <br> about adapting to the water effects climate change and using water more efficiently.[11]</p>
    

    <h3>Examples of activities</h3>
    <p>Non-governmental organizations active in the WASH sector, such as UNICEF, WaterAid and Water and Sanitation <br> for the Urban Poor (WSUP), use the day to raise public awareness, get media attention for water issues and inspire action.[13] Activities have included releasing publications and films, as well as organizing round tables, seminars and expositions.[3]

        End Water Poverty, a global civil society coalition with 250 partner organizations, sponsors Water <br> Action Month each year and offers an event-planning guidebook.[14][15]
        
        The UN World Water Development Report (WWDR) is released each year on World Water Day. Information related to <br> the annual theme gives decision-makers tools to implement sustainable use of water resources.[16]
        
        More and more initiatives in schools and universities are educating people about the importance of conserving and managing <br> water resources.[17][18][19] For example, Michigan State University held a contest for "best World Water Day poster" in 2017. Primary school children in the Philippines participated in a "My School Toilet" contest in 2010.[20]</p>
