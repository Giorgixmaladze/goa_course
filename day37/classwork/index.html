            <p>World War II[b] or the Second World War (1 September 1939 – 2 September 1945) was a global <br>
                 conflict between two alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. Nearly all of the world's countries, <br>
                  including all of the great powers, participated in the conflict, and many invested all available economic, <br>
                   industrial, and scientific capabilities in pursuit of total war, blurring the distinction between civilian <br>
                    and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and <br>
                     delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. It was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting <br>
                      in 70–85 million fatalities. Millions died due to genocides, including the Holocaust, as well as starvation, massacres,<br>
                       and disease. In the wake of Axis defeat, Germany, Austria, Japan and Korea were occupied, and war crime tribunals were <br>
                        conducted against German and Japanese leaders.
                The causes of the war are debated; contributing factors included the rise of fascism in Europe, <br>
                 the Spanish Civil War, the Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, and tensions in the <br>
                   aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi <br>
                    Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded</p>

            <p> World War I[j] or the First World War (28 July 1914 – 11 November 1918) was a global <br>
                 conflict between two coalitions: the Allies (or Entente) and the Central Powers. Fighting <br>
                  took place mainly in Europe and the Middle East, as well as parts of Africa and the Asia-Pacific, <br>
                   and was characterised by trench warfare and the use of artillery, machine guns, and chemical weapons (gas). <br>
                    World War I was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, resulting in an estimated 9 million military dead <br>
                     and 23 million wounded, plus up to 8 million civilian deaths from causes <br>
                 including genocide. The movement of large numbers of troops and civilians was a <br>
                  major factor in spreading the Spanish flu pandemic.</p>
